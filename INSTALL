Install imapfilter

copy config.lua and account.lua to ~/.imapfilter/

Edit your ~/.imapfilter/account.lua to change any imap server flags

Put imapfilter.sh somewhere in your path (~/bin/imapfilter.sh is a good spot) - 
add a line to your shell init script (eg .bashrc) to run imapfilter.sh

If you like, put the included passwd.sh somewhere in your .bashrc - this
will make sure any changes to passwd result in a restart of imapfilter, with
the new mail password.

Done!
